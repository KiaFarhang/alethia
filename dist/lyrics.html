                        We are resilient,
                        <br> We fall, we learn, we rise
                        <br> Desire to be,
                        <br> We will give everything
                        <br>
                        <br> We will give everything
                        <br>
                        <br> If you're not on solid ground,
                        <br> The dark of the world will break you down,
                        <br> Leaving you helpless and defenseless,
                        <br> In constant stress
                        <br>
                        <br> It is your job to pick yourself up and say,
                        <br> "These are my aspirations, I will not let myself down"
                        <br> Don't choose to dwell on negativity,
                        <br> Thicken your skin and push through the pain
                        <br>
                        <br> What we learn in the wake of our sorrows burn
                        <br> Like fire within our souls
                        <br>
                        <br> If your heart still beats,
                        <br> No trial can break you down
                        <br>
                        <br> In the darkness,
                        <br> We burn misguided words
                        <br> You can't silence,
                        <br> Those with resilience
                        <br>
                        <br> We'll give it our all
                        <br> We'll give it our all
                        <br>
                        <br> A world content with indifference,
                        <br> Can make us feel so insignificant
                        <br> Push through the pain
                        <br> Push through the pain
                        <br>
                        <br> And if I gave up,
                        <br> I would be nothing
                        <br> I would be nothing
                        <br> And if I gave up,
                        <br> I would be nothing
                        <br>
                        <br> In the darkness,
                        <br> We burn misguided words
                        <br> You can't silence,
                        <br> Those with resilience
                        <br>
                        <br> In the darkness we find,
                        <br> The strength within ourselves,
                        <br> The will to overcome
                        <br> You cant silence,
                        <br> Those with resilience,
                        <br> Those with resilience
                        <br>
                        <br> Desire to be,
                        <br> We are the resilient,
                        <br> And we will give everything
                        <br> We will give everything
                        <br>
                        <br> We are resilient,
                        <br> We fall, we learn, we rise
                        <br> Desire to be,
                        <br> We will give everything

                        <br> Lending a helping hand

                        <br> Deceiving with their trusting grin,

                        <br>

                        <br> I am but a stepping stone to their prize.
                        <br>
                        <br> With their hands behind their backs, a knife hidden,

                        <br>
                        <br> Why do the ones we trust the most view us as wolves,
                        <br> Ready to prey on their lives,
                        <br> When those who don't trust their allies are the real wolves in disguise.

                        <br>
                        <br> Pointing your finger, screaming at the sky,

                        <br> That waging petty battles is what you do.
                        <br> Maybe it’s not everyone, maybe it’s you.

                        I lay awake tonight, eyes closed but my mind in thought.
                        <br> Regret of what could have been,
                        <br> The pain of what wouldnt mend,
                        <br> Now surrounds my still body.
                        <br>
                        <br> I need an outlet, my mind's overflowing.
                        <br> My mind's overflowing.
                        <br>
                        <br> So I turn to the only thing I know,

                        <br> The comfort of sorting my demons,
                        <br> The comfort of laying it out.
                        <br>
                        <br> I watch the world before me,
                        <br> Pour down like rain onto the rising flames,
                        <br> And in my deepest musings,
                        <br> Theyre written frame by frame.
                        <br> Inside our hearts theres a martyr from the start,
                        <br> But I’m now unrestrained.
                        <br>
                        <br> These nights drag on, but pen in hand I will push through.

                        <br>
                        <br> These thoughts left with nowhere to run.
                        <br> Unraveled, understand what’s done is done.
                        <br> Regret of what could have been,
                        <br> The pain of what wouldnt mend,
                        <br> Still unfolds but leaves me numb.

                        <br>
                        <br> It’s tearing at the seams,

                        <br> Ambition like sunrise.
                        <br> Hidden, in disguise,
                        <br> By the shadow you stand behind.
                        <br>
                        <br> Is this what you wanted, just mediocrity.
                        <br> Living in discontent for consistency.
                        <br>
                        <br> But why?
                        <br> Why do you live this lie? (This lie)
                        <br> Why?
                        <br> Why do you live this lie?
                        <br>
                        <br> I can see it in your eyes,
                        <br> Ambition like sunrise.
                        <br> Hidden, in disguise,
                        <br> By the shadow you stand behind.

                        <br> A sense of doubt, ignored by most,
                        <br> But it’s obvious to me, it was meant to make us fall,
                        <br> To our knees,

                        What she once held,
                        <br> Love in shades of green,
                        <br> We throw away,
                        <br> We watch the seas turn grey.
                        <br>
                        <br> This realization I've come to see,
                        <br> Our hearts are withering away now,
                        <br> Within the throws of devestation.
                        <br> This is her darkest hour, as we continue to devour.
                        <br> Her passion now dies, this too is our demise.
                        <br>
                        <br> Beauty hidden by apathy,
                        <br> Misguided intentions, destroying future generations.
                        <br> Apathy condemning all to agony,
                        <br> Lost to our damnation.
                        <br>
                        <br> She is our mother,

                        <br>
                        <br> We seem to forget she is our only home.

                        <br> When she can’t even breathe the air (the air)
                        <br>
                        <br> She can’t breathe the air.

                        <br> She carries our weight on her shoulders,
                        <br> But its too much to bare.
                        <br> She’s barely breathing, she’s half-alive,
                        <br> Can we save her now?
                        <br> Can we save her in time?
